                <marquee>The Quit India Movement, initiated on August 8, 1942, by Mahatma Gandhi, was a significant anti-colonial struggle in India. Gandhi's call of "Do or Die" marked its urgency. Originally a civil disobedience effort, it evolved into a forceful rejection of British rule. Gandhi, foreseeing potential violence, believed in morally defending against the state's organized force. Known as the "August Kranti Movement," it not only challenged colonial authority but also set the stage for pivotal events in Indian history over the next five years.</marquee>

                <h4 className="quite_heading">Causes of Quit India Movement</h4>
                <p className="quite_paragraph">The Quit India Movement was the culmination of years of Indian disillusionment with British rule, with the immediate causes being the failure of Cripps mission, hardships caused during World War II and the Japanese knocking at the doors of Indian borders. Some of the major causes of the Quit India Movement are as follows:</p>
                <ul className="quite_listitem">
        <li>
          <strong>The attitude of the British Government:</strong>
          <ul className="quite_listitem1">
            <li>The Indian people grew disillusioned with the British government's failure to fulfill promises on India's self-rule.</li>
            <li>Despite Indian support in World War II, the British were reluctant to transfer power easily.</li>
            <li>The August offer and Cripps mission failed to satisfy nationalist demands.</li>
            <li>British support for the demand of Pakistan by the Muslim League infuriated Indian nationalists, particularly Gandhi.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Growing Nationalism:</strong>
          <ul className="quite_listitem1">
            <li>By 1942, India's struggle for independence had been ongoing for decades.</li>
            <li>Nationalistic sentiments were at their peak, with growing impatience with British rule.</li>
            <li>The Quit India Movement reflected the extent of this sentiment.</li>
            <li>People had participated wholeheartedly in the Individual Satyagraha movements of 1940 and the Kisan Sabha movements.</li>
            <li>Experience of self-rule during the Congress rule in 1937-39 fueled the desire to drive out the British.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Socio-Economic factors:</strong>
          <ul className="quite_listitem1">
            <li>India's participation in World War II placed economic burdens and restrictions on the country.</li>
            <li>The war effort led to rising prices, shortages of essential goods, and increased taxation.</li>
            <li>The shortage of essential goods and the export of rice caused the Bengal Famine of 1943.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The defeat of the British in World War II:</strong>
          <ul className="quite_listitem1">
            <li>Reverses suffered by the British in Southeast Asia and the advance of Japanese troops increased popular discontent.</li>
            <li>The retreat of British troops from Burma heightened fear.</li>
            <li>The British attitude exposed their racial discrimination policy.</li>
            <li>Indians felt the need for a nationalist government to defend borders.</li>
            <li>The failure of the Cripps Mission led to the final strike against the British by Gandhi and Congress.</li>
          </ul>

            <h4 className="quite_heading">Nature of the Quit India Movement</h4>
            <p className="quite_paragraph">Although the Movement was initially started as a civil disobedience movement, it differed from other movements launched by Gandhi.</p>
