                <marquee>Gandhi showed his belief in the doctrine and method of "Satyagraha," which he described as a "sovereign cure" in the hands of the "powerless" to contend with the most "powerful." Gandhi created the idea of Satyagraha, which included a quest for Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), and self-suffering in the 20th century. Gandhi questioned the idea of power as we know it and demonstrated to the world through his Satyagraha that the weaker members of society could be just as powerful in some situations as the strong.</marquee>

                    <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Satyāgraha, derived from Sanskrit, is a specific manifestation of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance, synonymous with "holding firmly to truth" or "truth force." A practitioner of satyagraha is referred to as a satyagrahi. The term satyagraha was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), who applied this principle in the Indian independence movement and earlier struggles in South Africa advocating for Indian rights. The theory of satyagraha had a profound impact on campaigns led by Martin Luther King Jr. and James Bevel during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. It also played a significant role in Nelson Mandela's </p>
                    <h4 className="Satyagraha_heading">Origin of Satyagraha</h4>
                    <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Gandhi decided to unite the "coloured" people and fight for their rights after seeing the disgusting racist injustice in South Africa. Gandhi first used Leo Tolstoy's phrase "passive resistance" to describe the mass uprising against the discriminatory administration. Yet, Gandhi was concerned about the phrase "passive resistance" because it was unfamiliar to him, and its connotations were insufficient to emphasise the virtues of truth and moral bravery Gandhi associated with peaceful political struggle. Moreover, it separated political goals from underlying intellectual principles, placing political goals first. Gandhi wanted an Indian phrase that could include all of these revolutionary elements.</p>
                    <h4 className="Satyagraha_heading">Satyagraha Meaning</h4>
                    <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Gandhi renamed the movement he intended to start by changing the word "Sad" to "Satya" and "Satyagraha." The word "Sat" connotes transparency, fairness, and truth.</p>

                    <ul className="Satyāgraha_underlist">
                        <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Sat:</strong> The root of the word Satya, meaning truth. Truth is the only thing that truly exists (M.K. Gandhi, Young India, July 30, 1931).</li>
                        
                        <li  className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Satyagraha:</strong> Translates as demand for the truth. This determination gives the votary unmatched strength.</li>
                        
                        <li  className="Satyāgraha_underlist1">The term "<strong>satyagraha</strong>" described the Indians' nonviolent direct action against the government's racial policy. It is the persistent pursuit of just goals using nonviolent means.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4 className="Satyagraha_heading">Sources of the Idea of Satyagraha</h4>
                        <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">The foundational premise of Gandhi's political doctrine, Ahimsa, or non-violence, which was based on the theological teachings of Jainism, Buddhism, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita, was "Satyagraha." The Upanishads assert that satya, or truth, is the foundation upon which the entire world is built. Buddha propagated the idea of Ahimsa, or non-violence, and held that hatred could be vanquished not with more hatred but with love. Ahimsa was regarded as the purest form of religion by Mahavira. Many tales in Hindu mythology, particularly those involving Raja Harishchandra, laud the virtue of sticking with the truth no matter what. The teachings of Jesus Christ and Socrates rest on Satyagraha's ideals.</p>
                        <h4 className="Satyagraha_heading">Principles of Satyagraha</h4>
                        <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Gandhi viewed satyagraha not just as a political tactic but as a universal solution for injustice. He established the Sabarmati Ashram to teach satyagraha, emphasizing principles inspired by Yoga Sutra:</p>
                        <ul className="Satyāgraha_underlist">
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Nonviolence (ahimsa)</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Truthful living</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Non-stealing</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Non-possession (distinct from poverty)</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Body or bread labor</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Desire control (avoiding gluttony)</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Fearlessness</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Equal respect for all religions</strong></li>
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Economic strategies like boycotting imported goods (swadeshi)</strong></li>
                     </ul>
                     <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">In another instance, he outlined these essential rules for every Indian Satyagrahi:</p>
                     <ul className="Satyāgraha_underlist">
                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Must have unwavering faith in God</strong></li>

                            <li className="Satyāgraha_underlist1"><strong>Abstain from alcohol and intoxicants</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                    <h4  className="Satyagraha_heading">The Idea of Satyagraha</h4>
                    <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Let us look at the various features of the idea of Satyagraha.</p>
                        <h4 className="Satyagraha_heading">Passive Resistance And Satyagraha </h4>
                        <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Satyagraha, rooted in the belief of nonviolent resistance, advocates for resolving conflicts through love and patient suffering. It contrasts with passive resistance, which seeks to submit the opponent through humiliation. Satyagraha is an active, positive approach, rejecting violence under all circumstances, while passive resistance is static and may involve violence. The essence of Satyagraha lies in fighting against injustice without harboring ill intent or hatred, emphasizing the power of nonviolence as a potent force for change.</p>
                            <h4  className="Satyagraha_heading">Satyagraha As A Revolution</h4>
                            <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Gandhi's Satyagraha advocated change through moral influence, aiming to transform wrongdoers without resorting to violence. It emphasized purifying relationships and demonstrating that injustice requires the cooperation of the injured. Often called "silent force" or "soul force," Satyagraha sought moral power over physical authority, embodying a philosophy of nonviolence.</p>
                            <h4  className="Satyagraha_heading">Satyagraha and Nationalism </h4>
                            <p className="Satyāgraha_paragraph">Gandhi, while appreciating the extremists' sacrifice for the mother country, opposed their violence. He advocated nonviolent movements like Satyagraha and Ahimsa, considering them more potent than radical methods. Satyagraha, rooted in the "rule of suffering," views enduring suffering as a means to moral progress. Refusal to cooperate becomes a strategy to seek the opponent's participation in a just cause. Gandhi emphasized the duty of non-cooperation with evil and popularized various nonviolent tactics, collectively known as "Satyagraha."</p>
